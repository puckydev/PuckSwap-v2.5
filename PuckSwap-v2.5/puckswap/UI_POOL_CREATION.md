# PuckSwap UI Pool Creation Feature

## Overview

The PuckSwap web interface now includes a user-friendly pool creation feature that guides users through the process of creating the initial ADA-tPucky liquidity pool.

## Features

### 1. Automatic Pool Detection
- When you connect your wallet, PuckSwap automatically checks if a liquidity pool exists
- If no pool is found, a prominent alert appears with a "Create Pool" button
- The swap interface is disabled until a pool is created

### 2. Pool Creation Modal
- Click "Create Pool" to open the pool creation interface
- Shows clear pool parameters:
  - Initial ADA: 10,000 ADA
  - Initial tPucky: 10,000,000,000 tPucky
  - Trading Fee: 0.3%
  - Expected LP Tokens: ~316,227,766 LP

### 3. Balance Requirements Check
- Real-time balance checking shows if you have sufficient funds
- Green checkmarks indicate met requirements
- Red X marks indicate insufficient balance
- The "Create Pool" button is only enabled when all requirements are met

### 4. Safety Features
- Clear warning about token locking in the liquidity pool
- Confirmation required before creating the pool
- Transaction hash displayed for tracking
- Automatic UI refresh after pool creation

## How to Use

1. **Start the UI Server**
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

2. **Connect Your Wallet**
   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - If you have both Nami and VESPR installed, select your preferred wallet
   - Approve the connection in your wallet

3. **Create the Pool**
   - If no pool exists, you'll see the pool creation alert
   - Click "Create Pool"
   - Review the requirements and ensure you have sufficient funds
   - Click "Create Pool" in the modal to proceed

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed
- Pool detection UI flow
- Balance requirement checking
- Modal interface with parameters
- Wallet connection integration
- Error handling and user feedback

### In Progress
- Direct transaction building from the UI
- Currently shows CLI instructions as a fallback

### Future Enhancements
- Full browser-based pool creation without CLI
- Custom pool parameter inputs
- Multiple pool pair support
- Pool analytics dashboard

## Technical Notes

The UI currently uses a hybrid approach:
1. Full UI for balance checking and parameter display
2. CLI fallback for actual pool creation transaction

This ensures users can still create pools while we work on the full browser-based implementation.

## Troubleshooting

### "Pool creation from the UI is coming soon!"
This message appears because the browser-based transaction building is still being implemented. Use the CLI command shown in the modal:
```bash
npm run setup-pool
```

### Balance not updating
- Refresh the page after making transactions
- Ensure your wallet is properly connected
- Check that you're on the Cardano preprod testnet

### Modal won't close
- Click the X button or click outside the modal
- Refresh the page if needed
